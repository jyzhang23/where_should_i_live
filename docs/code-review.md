The current "City Tinder" game is engaging, but it suffers from profile overlap. The current list contains too many cities that appeal to the same demographic (liberal, young, tech/creative, mid-sized): Austin, Nashville, Portland, and Denver are statistically very similar.To get better "inferential power" (i.e., to accurately guess user preferences from just 10 swipes), you need cities that act as polarizing filters for specific traits. You need distinct archetypes that force the user to reveal their dealbreakers (e.g., "I hate winter," "I need safety," "I refuse to pay state tax").Here is a recommended replacement list of 10 cities selected specifically to maximize scoring variance across your 6 new categories (Values, Cost, Climate, QoL, Entertainment, Demographics).The "High-Signal" City ListCurrentProposed ReplacementThe "Signal" (Why this city?)New York CityKeepThe Urban Baseline. Tests tolerance for Cost and Density. A "Right" swipe is the strongest signal for walkability and nightlife.San FranciscoKeepThe Cost Test. Tests if climate + jobs > cost. If they swipe left here but right on Seattle, you know Cost is the dealbreaker.MiamiKeepThe Heat/Party Test. Strongest signal for warm climate and nightlife. Filters out users who hate humidity.DenverKeepThe Active/Nature Test. The standard for outdoor + 4-seasons.PhoenixLas Vegas, NVThe Entertainment Test. Vegas is a sharper signal for entertainment importance without the "suburban family" vibe of Phoenix. It also tests desert climate tolerance.BostonMinneapolis, MNThe Winter Test. Boston is expensive; Minneapolis is affordable but has brutal winters. Swiping Right on Minneapolis proves the user values QoL (Safety/Schools) over Climate.PortlandSeattle, WAThe Gloom Test. Seattle is the archetype for "Gray/Rainy." It’s a stronger brand for testing tolerance of cloudyDays than Portland.NashvilleNew Orleans, LAThe "Vibe vs. Safety" Test. NOLA has incredible culture but very poor safety metrics. A Right swipe here strongly deprioritizes safety weight in favor of culture.AustinSalt Lake City, UTThe Values Test. Austin overlaps with Denver/Nashville. SLC introduces a strong religious and family signal while maintaining the nature aspect. It tests if "Values" matter to the user.ChicagoBoise, IDThe Safety/Conservative Test. Chicago is similar to NYC (Urban/Cold). Boise offers a totally different profile: Safe, Conservative, Homogenous, Affordable. It captures the user who wants to escape the city.How this improves the algorithmWith this specific mix, you can use Triangulation to determine weights more accurately:Determining safety weight:User likes New Orleans but rejects Boise: Safety weight should be 0% (User prioritizes fun/culture).User likes Boise but rejects New Orleans: Safety weight should be High (User prioritizes stability).Determining climate preferences:User likes Minneapolis and Denver: They are "Winter Tolerant" (Set preferSnow to true).User likes Miami and Vegas: They are "Sun Chasers" (Set minComfortDays high).Determining values (Politics/Religion):User likes Seattle and NYC (Strong Blue) but rejects SLC and Boise (Red/Purple): Set partisanPreference to "Democrat".User likes SLC and Boise: Set partisanPreference to "Republican" or "Conservative".Summary of ChangesBy swapping out the "Trendy Mid-Sized Cities" (Austin, Nashville, Portland) for Polarizing Archetypes (New Orleans, Boise, SLC), you turn the game from a "popularity contest" into a true preference diagnostic tool.Removed: Phoenix, Boston, Nashville, Portland, Chicago, Austin.Added: Las Vegas, Minneapolis, Seattle, New Orleans, Salt Lake City, Boise.

Expanding the deck to 12 cities allows us to introduce finer granularity, specifically separating "Old World Urbanism" (Boston) from "Sprawl Urbanism" (Houston) and distinguishing "Nature Access" (Denver) from "Values-Driven Community" (Salt Lake City).Here is the optimal 12-city roster designed to maximize algorithmic variance.The "Dirty Dozen" ArchetypesThis list is engineered so that no two cities test the exact same combination of preferences.CityArchetypeThe Signal (What a "Like" tells us)1. New York City, NYThe MetropolisBaseline Urbanism. High tolerance for cost & density. Strongest signal for walkability and nightlife.2. Boise, IDThe Safe HavenSafety & Stability. Strong signal for safety and homogeneity. Rejects "chaos" and "politics" in favor of peace.3. San Francisco, CAThe Golden HandcuffsOpportunity vs. Cost. Tests if career + climate > cost. If they like this but hate NYC, they prioritize weather over nightlife.4. Minneapolis, MNThe Nordic ModelQoL vs. Climate. High QoL, low cost, brutal winter. A "Like" here proves the user values infrastructure (schools/safety) over weather.5. Miami, FLThe HeatVibe Check. Tests tolerance for humidity and flashiness. Strong signal for diverse demographics and nightlife but low safety.6. Salt Lake City, UTThe CommunityValues Test. High nature but distinct religious culture. Tests if the user prioritizes shared values/family over urban amenities.7. New Orleans, LAThe SoulCulture vs. Stats. Terrible stats (crime, economy) but unmatched soul. A "Like" prioritizes arts/culture and dining over safety.8. Seattle, WAThe Grey TechGloom Tolerance. Tests if nature + jobs > sunshine. Distinguishes "Sun Chasers" (Miami) from "Nature Lovers" (Seattle).9. Las Vegas, NVThe PlaygroundPure Entertainment. High amenities, low cost, desert climate. Separates "Suburban" families (Phoenix) from "Fun" seekers (Vegas).10. Boston, MAThe Ivy LeagueOld World QoL. Walkable, historic, educated, expensive. Distinguishes users who want smart/healthy cities vs. just fun ones.11. Houston, TXThe SprawlAffordable Scale. Massive scale, high diversity, low cost, no zoning. Tests if user prefers space and affordability over walkability.12. Denver, COThe PlaygroundActive Balance. The baseline for "4-Seasons + Outdoors." The control group for users who want a bit of everything.Variance Matrix: How the Algorithm Sees ThemThis table shows how these 12 cities create a "fingerprint" across your 6 scoring categories.

(This is a key insight often missed).This 12-city deck provides a mathematically robust dataset to initialize your Zustand store weights before the user even touches the "Advanced" tab.
